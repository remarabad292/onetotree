SUMMARY
Protecting the earth, preserving its resources, and saving endangered species are all noble endeavors. However, all of these are for naught when not acted upon. In this article, we will discover the various concrete ways you can do your part in contributing to a greener earth. Whether it is reducing your carbon footprint, planting more native trees, or choosing to donate money to worthy initiatives and causes such as One To Tree, your small effort is already a big step towards a better tomorrow.

You can start your journey for greener earth by reading the article that details what you can do within/below.

If there is anything that humans fail at, it is seeing the big picture. 

With most of us blind to see the interconnectedness of life, we are rendered unaware of how even the tiniest microorganisms can play a significant role in our survival. Keep in mind that life is a complicated web of interdependent beings. The survival of each often depends on the survival of another. 

Some of us are only beginning to understand its implications and realize that the food chain—from the tiniest creatures to the largest beings on earth—keeps us alive. 

We all know that there are plenty of endangered species on earth. But, unfortunately, we are too absorbed with our own lives to realize that we are the ones causing it. That said, we are also the ones who can save it. 

Now, it is our time to give back. We should do our part in keeping them going extinct, not only for our survival but also for theirs. After all, this endeavor will play a pivotal role in the bigger picture: saving and protecting the ecosystem. So, if you wish to make a positive impact on the earth, be a responsible citizen and act on behalf of these threatened species and endangered wildlife—plants, animals, and the places they call their home. 

Below is a list of extraordinary things you, your family, and friends can do to help protect them. 


1.) Be Aware of the Endangered Species in Your Area

The first step to protecting and saving endangered species is making yourself aware of these species and sharing this information with others. More often than not, we tend to think of endangered species from other areas when there are some of them in your general vicinity. Educate your family and friends about the wildlife surrounding you, including the plants and animals that live near you. Awareness of these species is a critical step as it will help you and others to act in a way that would not put these species in danger. 

2.) Grow Native Plants

Local species rely on native plants, so it is only right to plant more of them. Also, you may want to grow more Philippine endangered trees, such as Narra and Kamagong. In this way, not only are you providing food and shelter for local wildlife, but you can attract native insects such as bees and butterflies to help pollinate your plants as well. Conversely, foreign species compete with native species for resources and habitat, which thereby threatens biodiversity. In fact, they have been known to prey on native species directly, which can cause native species to go extinct. 

3.) Buy Sustainable Products

Today, more and more of the natural world is plundered to satisfy consumerism. Unfortunately, this threatens local wildlife, and if we constantly raze our forests for the production of new goods, local wildlife may soon find themselves without a home. That said, you should never buy furniture made from endangered trees or wood from rainforests. Similarly, you should refrain from using palm oil as forests are constantly being cut down to make room for palm plantations. 

4.) Recycle and Buy Reusable Products 

To many people, recycling may be a tired cliche, but it is doing our environment a world of good. The simple act of recycling and buying eco-friendly products can already go a long way to help the ecosystem. With that in mind, consider every product you purchase and know what the consequences are should you purchase them. Keep in mind that there are products that cause harm to the homes of endangered species and even to the endangered species themselves. All that considered, do your research first and know what impact a product will make on the environment before buying it. 

5.) Reduce Your Carbon Footprint 

Endeavor to reduce your personal footprint and look for alternatives to the modern conveniences you are used to. It may be a little difficult at first, but it goes a long way in saving endangered species and the environment. That said, drive less and walk more. Leave your car home, commute and take the public transport. Similarly, you may also opt to buy food from your farmer’s market in lieu of shopping for them in big grocery chains. 

6.) Avoid Buying Plastic Products 

Do not forget to take your bags with you if you intend to go shopping. Similarly, reuse plastic containers instead of throwing them away. Also, plastic products end up in the ocean and maybe ingested by small fish. So, be sure to dispose of them properly. 

7.) Donate to organizations that are working to help endangered species 

Your donation can go a long way, and it does not take much of your time nor your money. Even the smallest amount can already be a big help. If you wish to put your money into a good cause, donating it to organizations such as One to Tree and the World Wildlife Fund can go a long way in ensuring endangered trees and animals are protected.
